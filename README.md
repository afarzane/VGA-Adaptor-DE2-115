# VGA-Adaptor-DE2-115

This project uses a VGA Adaptor Core to display lines and triangles onto a monitor, using a VGA-to-VGA connection from an Altera DE2-115 FPGA.

- Connect the monitor and FPGA using a VGA to VGA cable.
- Compile code and upload it onto the board.
- You should now see a triangle of different sizes at each clock cycle on the monitor.
- Use the reset button (KEY(3)) to start from the top.
- Use slider switches SW(7 downto 0) to control the base length of triangles and use KEY(0) to set this length
